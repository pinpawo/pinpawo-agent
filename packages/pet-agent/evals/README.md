# Pet Agent Evals

The eval data is organized around agent behavior, not around a single backend.
Langfuse and LangSmith are storage/runner integrations; the canonical cases live
in this package.

## Taxonomy

Suites group cases by the workflow they exercise. Tags classify the agent
capability each case covers:

- `route_control`: answer directly vs delegate work.
- `capability_search`: discover and select domain capabilities.
- `delegation_control`: avoid repeating completed work and continue unfinished work.
- `interruption_recovery`: resume interrupted or limit-reached work on the right lane.
- `permission_control`: preserve and apply user approvals safely.
- `context_synthesis`: answer from completed subagent context.
- `structured_output`: produce schema-compatible orchestration outputs.

This keeps broad agent quality dimensions visible even when a suite starts as a
single file such as `orchestrator-route`.

## Langfuse Dataset Sync

Start the local stack first:

```sh
npm run langfuse:up
```

Then sync canonical datasets into the local Langfuse project:

```sh
npm run eval:langfuse:sync-datasets
```

The sync script reads `infra/langfuse/.env` by default, or uses
`LANGFUSE_BASEURL`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` when set.
Dataset items use stable ids and are upserted; the script does not delete and
recreate datasets.

## Current Datasets

- `orchestrator-route-decision`: legacy route-decision cases wrapped in the canonical format.
- `agent-capability-search-basics`: basic capability discovery and capability-vs-general routing cases.
- `agent-delegation-control-basics`: multi-task delegation, completion detection, and finish-bias cases.
- `agent-interruption-recovery-basics`: resume, changed-intent, and approval-resume cases.
- `agent-permission-control-basics`: HITL authorization and permission-memory cases.
- `agent-context-synthesis-basics`: answer-from-context and missing-information cases.

The `agent-*` datasets are seed coverage for future runners. They are meant to
make the expected behavior explicit before each runner is migrated to Langfuse.
